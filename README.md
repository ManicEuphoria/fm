A personalized music radio algorithm

This personalized music radio algorithm is developed based on five basic concepts
1. `Personalization`.  The radio should play all songs either users have heard before or recommendation songs based on user music profile
2. `Matching user's mood`.  The system may decide it based on user's interaction with the system
3. `Minmum interaction`. If user does not like the currently playing songs, they can just skip current song instead of constantly clicking on like or dislike button.
4. `Continuity of the songs`. It should make sure the diveristy of the songs it will play, but it can also ensure continnuity between two songs.
5.  `Randomness without repitition`. There are no repitition of same songs in 50 songs, no repitition of the same artist in 10 songs
